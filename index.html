        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>I am a passionate programmer with experience in various programming languages and technologies, including Python, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. My expertise lies in both web development and data science, which allows me to build dynamic and user-friendly applications while also leveraging data to derive meaningful insights.

            Experience
            In the field of data analysis, I have honed my skills using powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, enabling me to manipulate datasets, create machine learning models, and solve complex problems effectively. Additionally, I have explored deep learning and AI applications using TensorFlow, expanding my knowledge in computer science and its practical applications.
            
            My projects range from developing interactive websites with responsive designs to analyzing and visualizing data for predictive modeling. This diverse experience has strengthened my problem-solving skills and given me a strong foundation in both technical and creative aspects of programming.
            
            I am continually exploring new technologies and methodologies to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving tech industry.</p>
